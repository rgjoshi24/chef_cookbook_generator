The benefits for your organization for creating this code generator are pretty huge:

You establish a standard way to lay out cookbooks.
You can include opinionated examples, that you can’t include in a public cookbook.
You can evolve the standards at your organization by simply updating the code generator.
You can include important, organization specific information in your .kitchen.yml so developers can use kitchen to test new cookbooks right away.
You can even use the code generator as a code review tool. “This is the way the generator does it, so please do it this way.”
It can be an important way to bring up inconsistencies in workflow in your organization.
